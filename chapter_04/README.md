# Chapter 4 Assignment

This week, I choose to do project 4.1 and 4.2

## Stack class
### Changed 
- Variable names to be more clear.
### Added 
- Remove whitespace from string before pushing into a Stack
- Exception for when popping from empty stack
- Exception for when pushing to a full stack 
- Functions `get_stack_str` and `get_reverse` for making checking for palindrome easier.
